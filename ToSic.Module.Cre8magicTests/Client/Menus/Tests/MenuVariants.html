    Menu Variants

<h2>Just us the Service & Data</h2>
<p>
    This would just be using the service, and looping etc.
    Examples:
</p>

@inject IMagicMenuService MenuSvc
@{
    var menuSettings = new MagicMenuSettings
    {
        MenuDesigner = basicDesigner,
        MenuItems = MenuTestData.dicTopLevelThreePage[currentEnv]
    };
    var menu = MenuSvc.GetMenu(PageState, menuSettings);
}
    
@foreach(var item in menu)
{
    <div>@item.Title</div>
}

<h2>Just the service - using Configs from elsewhere...?</h2>
<p>
    Not sure if this is a realistic scenario, but it would basically be the same thing,
    but the settings etc. would come from a central place...
    
    Not sure if this makes sense, because you could simply have a helper object which
    has the code elsewhere, to generate the settings, which is similar but less predefined architecture...
</p>

@inject IMagicMenuService MenuSvc
@inject MyMenuSettingsProvider MenuSettingsProvider
@{
    // Named Settings with somehow injected Settings provider
    // TODO: PROBABLY RENAME ConfigName to SettingsName or similar ???
    var menu2 = MenuSvc.GetMenu(PageState, new() { SettingsName = "footer" });
    
    // Same but "nicer"
    var menu2 = MenuSvc.GetMenu(PageState, "footer");

    // Named settings with manually specified settings provider
    var menu2 = MenuSvc.GetMenu(PageState, new() { SettingsProvider = MenuSettingsProvider, SettingsName = "footer" });

    // Named Settings with differing parameter
    var menu2 = MenuSvc.GetMenu(PageState, new() { SettingsProvider = MenuSettingsProvider, SettingsName = "footer", Start = "52, 41!" })
}

Note: some consequences would probably be that we would internall separate 
- settings
- runtime context containing logs, all-settings etc. ? - would make the settings less mutable in a good way...
- TODO: needs clarity as to how the new settings are mixed with provided settings


<h2>Just the service and just a Designer</h2>
<p>
    This scenario would be uncommon, but I guess would make sense architecturally.
    Basically you would use the service and a designer, to simply organize the code better.
</p>
@{
    var myDesigner = new MyMenuDesigner();
    var menu = MenuSvc.GetMenu(PageState, new() { Designer = myDesigner });
}

@foreach(var item in menu)
{
    <div class='item.Classes("div")'>@item.Title</div>
}

Notes:
- the designer could be preconfigured, in which case it doesn't need to know the menu settings
- in other cases the designer should know about the current settings - TODO: how?
- in other cases the designer should know about more global settings - TODO: how?

- We probably need to differentiate between Designer vs. DesigerFactory - the factory would be used to create a designer, and the designer would be used to render the menu
- ...or maybe also DesignerName / DesignerType, which would then use DI?


<h2>Using Pre-Built controls</h2>
<p>
    This would use the pre-built controls, which are already there.
</p>
<MagicMenu Settings="new()"></MagicMenu>

<MagicMenu Settings="new() { Designer = new MyMenuDesigner() }"></MagicMenu>

<MagicMenu Settings="new() { DesignerProvider = injectedProvider }"></MagicMenu>

<!-- maybe with name...?-->
<MagicMenu SettingsName="footer"></MagicMenu>
